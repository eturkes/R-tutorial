# How?

## Getting R
### Three main distributions (all free)
> 1. **CRAN**: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
>    + PROS: The main distribution *(recommended to start with)*.
>    + CONS: No additional features.
> 2. **MRO**: [https://mran.microsoft.com/open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open)
>    + PROS: Faster, snapshotted versions, default in Docker.
>    + CONS: Windows & Linux only, site goes down frequently.
> 3. **Conda**: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
>    + PROS: Built-in virtual environments, can use alongside Python.
>    + CONS: Buggiest and least official.

## Getting an IDE (integrated development environment)
### RStudio "the premier IDE for R"
> - [https://rstudio.com/](https://rstudio.com/)
> - RStudio Desktop for your PC and RStudio Server for running remotely or through containers.
> - Free version is fine, paid version only needed for very specific use cases.
